# hello-world


My name is Alexey and I plan to work my ass off to start programming in Unity to create awesome mobile games.

My plan is to start learning on learn.unity.com. There are plenty of courses to satisfy my needs as of a beginner learner.

I already have passed CwCL sessions and finished my first personal project. I've created a simple RPG game. I understand that there is a lot to learn about and I only saw a small amount of code available to create these awesome games. Next I need to finish user programmer certification
